Head over to Figma and create a new project.

I've created a starter file for you to use, and you can get that [here](https://www.figma.com/file/FUgY11amAHtmR2zyiHcSYs/FEM-Template?node-id=1%3A127)

Copy and paste over the existing artboards from the starter file into the respective tabs on your new project.

Now head over to [Coolors](https://coolors.co/browser/latest/1) and select a monochromatic color palette to use.

I chose the palette:

```
#A679DC
#8D53D2
#742DC8
#5F25A4
#050449
```

In your art board, create five 200 x 200 squares. You can create one and command + v to copy and paste, or press and hold option while dragging the shape to make a copy.

These five squares should have the fill of the five hex codes you've chosen.

Re-name each square to be `primary-100` through `primary-500`. Then select one of the squares, click the color style and click the plus button on the right side to add a new color.

You can then add labels to each of the squares so it's clear which color it is. I added both the hex and variable name.

We're also going to need a neutral palette.

I chose the neutral palette below:

```
neutral-600: #000000
neutral-500: #4A4B53
neutral-400: #737581
neutral-300: #E1E1E1
neutral-200: #F4F5F7
neutral-100: #FFFFFF
```

We'll also create text and text-inverted colors.

```
Text Color: #000000;
Text Color Inverted: #ffffff;
```

Once you've filled in your squares with your monochromatic palette, select the square with the color, then click the four menu dots underneath the Fill item in the right-hand sidebar, click the plus button and add the label `primary-X00`. This will allow you to use your colors within your components.

Take the next 15 minutes and find a monochromatic color palette you enjoy!
