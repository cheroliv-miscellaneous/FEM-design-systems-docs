#### HEX

Hex, or hexadecimal, is the base-16 representation of a color where each value can range from 0-9 and A-F.

#### RGB

RGB is the additive color mixing model which allows you to create colors by mixing red, green, and blue light sources. This is used in digital media design.

#### RGBA

RGBA is additive color mixing model which allows you to create colors by mixing red, green, and blue light sources, but incorporates a fourth value, alpha.

Alpha indicates how opaque each pixel is.
